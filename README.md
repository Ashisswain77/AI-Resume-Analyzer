## 🚀 Features

This AI-powered tool allows you to:

- 📄 Upload your resume, tailored to a specific **Company** and **Job Description**
- 🤖 Automatically evaluate and match your resume using **GPT** and **Claude**
- 📊 Instantly receive an **ATS score** with detailed insights and suggestions to improve your job match
- 💻 Everything runs directly in the browser — no backend or server-side logic involved

## 🧩 Why Puter.js?

[Puter.js](https://docs.puter.com/) brings cloud and AI capabilities directly to your frontend app with **just a single `<script>` tag** — no backend server or API infrastructure needed.

### ✨ With Puter.js, I integrated:
- 🔐 **Serverless Authentication** – users can sign up and log in securely without managing sessions or tokens
- 📁 **File Storage** – resumes are uploaded and stored using Puter’s cloud storage
- 🧠 **AI Services** – GPT & Claude APIs are accessed directly from the browser to analyze and score resumes
- 🧮 **KV Database** – job listings and resume evaluations are stored and queried with ease

And the best part?

> 🧾 **Zero infrastructure costs** — users pay for their own usage, and the app can scale infinitely without costing you anything as the developer.

Puter is also **privacy-focused**: it doesn’t track users, collect personal info, or monetize data.

## 💼 Use Case: Deloitte Resume Test

To put the analyzer to the test, I uploaded my own resume and tailored it to a **Deloitte** job description. The AI instantly assessed the fit and provided improvement suggestions — all in the browser. Try the same with your resume!
